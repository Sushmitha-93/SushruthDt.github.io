									<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
								</header>
                                <p> I'll be eternally grateful to Webtrigon for my first internship, where I got my first taste of product management while interning for a company shortly after finishing my bachelor's degree, where I worked on SaaS software and websites, gathering requirements and designing wireframes. I witnessed the entire product development process, from research to planning to design to implementation and release.</p>
                                <p>I started out as a data analyst, assisting the product management team in making decisions as part of product development. I gradually learned business processes and was promoted to business analyst, where I optimized and upgraded the most complex process workflows in the application to make it financially compliant with regulatory boards, saving them nearly $400k USD per year. Within a year, I was promoted to product owner and was one of the youngest in Accenture India, where I, along with three other Product Owners, migrated the entire application from packaged software to a standalone one that we built from the ground up in an agile environment. was in charge of everything from ideation to design, implementation, and post-release support.The next on the product roadmap was to make applications intelligent by incorporating AI; unfortunately, we lacked the necessary product talent to carry this out.
                                </p>
                                <p>After recognizing the gap, I assumed that masters would provide me with an advantage, and I envision myself installing AI features on applications. I was given the opportunity to intern with an adtech company as a product development intern, where I worked with a team to brainstorm and develop new MVPs/prototypes for the company. I also worked with product analytics to develop strategies for increasing foot traffic to our product by optimizing search engine attributes of the website and product.
                                </p>
                                <p>After that check point in my life, having gained experience in UX, content management , social media marketing and product management and I thought pursuing masters in data science would put in the top skill bracket , so that I can help companies in installing intelligent AI features onto their product. 
                                </p>
